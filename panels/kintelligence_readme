Notes on the kinteligence VCF file

We have the RS numbers for the kinship snps in the kintelligence panel
AND
we have a bed file for all SNPs in the panel.

The bed file was lifted to the hg38 reference genome. 1 snp failed to liftover (see unmapped, note2self)
it's on the X, and there is a bug in the reference (hg19) at that position

To get the BCF file, we took all of the common sites (MAF >5% in at least one population) from gnomad (autosomes only, v3_1_2)
and intersected the hg38 bed file with the gnomad sites VCF file.
Next, we removed indels (that spanned the site), and we get the right number of SNPs back (9867)

Note: Apparently kintelligence uses "all" of the autosomal SNPs when it runs gedmatch.
However, one of the SNPs is an INDEL (N29insA) (fine, that's a SNP too)
and it is unlikely to be used by gedmatch (and it does not appeach to be in gnomad, which is where the annotations come from)

Also, SNP rs3795817 is not annotated as having that RS number (the snp is there, by chromosome position and allele, just the rs is '.')
I manually re-added the RS number
AND
The following phenotypic markers:

chr16   89985917        89985918        rs1805006
chr16   89986090        89986091        rs11547464
chr16   89986121        89986122        rs201326893_Y152OCH
chr16   89986129        89986130        rs1110400
chr16   89986545        89986546        rs1805009

failed to be found in gnomad (as annotated)
and they are excluded.

Additionally, the Forenseq reference guide:
https://verogen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/forenseq-kintelligence-reference-guide-vd2020053-b.pdf

Provides the RS number of 173 SNPs that were excluded (post hoc) for various reasons.
It seems prudent to exclude them here, too.
