# Quick start

## Install dependencies

### Mamba
Install mamba. If you haven't already done so, I suggest following the directions found [here](https://www.usna.edu/Users/cs/fknoll/SD211/mamba.html)
<br>
(but ignoring the ```mamba create``` command. <br>
Install the dependencies
```
mamba install bioconda::pysam snakemake r-tidyverse r-Hmisc samtools bcftools
```

### Au Naturel
Ensure the following packages are installed:
- pysam
- snakemake
- R
-- tidyverse
-- Hmisc
as well as samtools and bcftools (any modern version should do)

## Install snp2id

###
clone this package. <br>
change directories to whereever you want your data to reside. **then **
```
git clone 

## Download the hg38 reference genome
Okay, so there are a lot of "reference genomes". We want the one used by the 1000 Genomes project.
